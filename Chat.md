# !!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!
## For each request, it is essential to include the following three main query parameters:
# seller_id - For creating a new chat if there is no room_id. Even if it does, you should send it for proper work.
# room_id - The identifier of the room.
# token - The JWT token generated during login and saved in your local state.
